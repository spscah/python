# python
An introductory python course

This course takes you on a step by step course through learning python. 

Each week should has a focus, with questions for discussion in class and then to spend some time working at home or in your own time. 

This course is heavily influenced by [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/), although some of the exercises are very different.

## File types 

The files shown in these folders are a mixture of `.md' files which are markdown (a way of marking text to show how it should be shown, like HTML) and of 'Jupyter notebooks' which are an interactive file type, allowing python to be shown alongside text and then run by the user. (When displayed via [github.com], though, they will be static HTML files.)
